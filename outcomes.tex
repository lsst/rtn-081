\section{Outcomes and Conclusions} \label{sec:outcomes}

This annual iterative process enables change to happen in a controlled and transparent manner, enabling buy-in at all levels on a) what the upcoming FY priorities are and b) the reasons behind difficult decisions which are often inevitable. 
It should be noted that changes can still happen throughout the year through a process called Request Beyond Target (RBT), which enables team leads to request mid-year enhancements to their programs. 
This process is outside of the scope of this paper, but is mentioned here to stress the agile nature of planning at Rubin.

Year on year, as this process takes place from now through to the end of the ten-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time expected in 2037, the scrub process is envisaged to evolve.
ach iteration is expected to reveal gaps and areas of improvement that can be fed into the design of the process and the tools for the following fiscal yearâ€™s scrub.
